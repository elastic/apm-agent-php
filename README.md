# Elastic APM Agent for PHP

This is the official PHP agent for [Elastic APM](https://www.elastic.co/products/apm).

The PHP agent enables you to trace the execution of operations in your application, sending performance metrics and errors to the Elastic APM server.

:ballot_box_with_check: We'd love to get information about your setup to help us with prioritizing framework support â€“ please take a minute to fill out [our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8c3BJVMqaeuqpq-t3_Q4NilNcdsrzK1qJ4Qo9JpJslrmYzA/viewform).

If you have any feedback or questions,
please post them at the [Discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm).

## Usage

This agent is a PHP extension that must be installed in your PHP environment.

See the [documentation](docs) for setup and configuration details.

## Contributing

See [contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Local development

If you don't want to install any of the dependencies you might need to compile and install the library then you can use the Dockerfile.

```bash
## To prepare the build docker container
PHP_VERSION=7.2 make -f .ci/Makefile prepare

## To compile the library
PHP_VERSION=7.2 make -f .ci/Makefile build

## To test the library
PHP_VERSION=7.2 make -f .ci/Makefile test

## To install the library
PHP_VERSION=7.2 make -f .ci/Makefile install

## To install with composer
PHP_VERSION=7.2 make -f .ci/Makefile composer
```

_NOTE_: `PHP_VERSION` can be set to a different PHP version.


To generate the packages then you can use the `packaging/Dockerfile`.

```bash
## To build the docker image that will be used later on for packaging the project
make -C packaging build

## To create the rpm package
make -C packaging rpm

## To create the deb package
make -C packaging deb

## To create all the packages that are supported
make -C packaging package

## To list the metadata info of the above generated packages
make -C packaging info

## To test the installation in debian
make -C packaging deb-install
```

_NOTE_: current implementation requires to use `make -C packaging <target>` since the workspace
        is mounted as a volume.
