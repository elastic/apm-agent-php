== Configuration

You can utilize configuration options to adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs.
One way to do this is to configure settings in an `elastic_apm.ini` file:

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.server_url = http://localhost:8200
elastic_apm.service_name = "Unknown PHP service"
elastic_apm.log_level = 0
----

The agent can also be configured at runtime with the following PHP code:

[source,php]
----
ini_set('elastic_apm.server_url', 'http://localhost:8200');
ini_set('elastic_apm.service_name', 'My_Test_Service');
ini_set('elastic_apm.log_level', 'DEBUG');
----

[[configure-ess]]
=== {ess} on {ecloud}

The agent can be configured to send data to an {ess-product}[{ess} APM instance] by
configuring the `elastic_apm.server_url` and `elastic_apm.secret_token` found in the APM section of {ecloud}:

Configure in `elastic_apm.ini`:

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.server_url = APM_SERVER_URL
elastic_apm.secret_token = TOKEN
elastic_apm.service_name = SERVICE_NAME
----

Or, with the following PHP code:

[source,php]
----
ini_set('elastic_apm.server_url', 'APM_SERVER_URL');
ini_set('elastic_apm.secret_token', 'TOKEN');
----

[[configure-logging]]
=== Logging

Available log levels are:

[source,text]
----
OFF
CRITICAL
ERROR
WARNING
NOTICE
INFO
DEBUG
TRACE
----
`OFF` is only used to disable agent logging.
There cannot be log records with level `OFF`.

For example, if you specify `WARNING` log level, only log records with levels `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`
will be emitted.

The agent supports logging to the following sinks: syslog and stderr.
You can control the level of logging for individual sinks with the
`elastic_apm.log_level_syslog` and `elastic_apm.log_level_stderr` keys.
When a sink-specific logging level is not set explicitly, the fallback setting,
`elastic_apm.log_level`, will be used.

For example, the following configuration sets the log level to `NOTICE` for all the sinks:

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.log_level=NOTICE
----

Alternatively, the following configuration sets log level to `NOTICE` for all the sinks except for `syslog`, whose log level is set to `TRACE`.

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.log_level=NOTICE
elastic_apm.log_level_syslog=TRACE
----

[[configuration-reference]]
=== Configuration reference

[float]
[[config-enabled]]
==== `enabled`

By default, the Elastic APM extension is enabled.
It can be disabled by setting `elastic_apm.enabled=false`.

[float]
[[config-server-url]]
==== `server_url`

`elastic_apm.server_url`

The URL for your APM Server.

[float]
[[config-secret-token]]
==== `secret_token`

`elastic_apm.secret_token`

Used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM server.
Both the agents and the APM server have to be configured with the same secret token.
Use this setting if the APM Server requires a token, like in {ess}.

[float]
[[config-service-name]]
==== `service_name`

`elastic_apm.service_name`

Groups all of the errors and transactions of your service together.
This is the primary filter in the APM app.

[float]
[[config-service-version]]
==== `service_version`

`elastic_apm.service_version`

The version of the currently deployed service. If you don’t version your deployments,
the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g.,
the output of git rev-parse HEAD.

[float]
[[config-log-level]]
==== `log_level`

`elastic_apm.log_level`

Fallback configuration setting to control the logging level for the agent.
This setting has effect for the sink when sink specific option is not set explicitly.
See <<configure-logging>> for details.

This setting doesn't have a default value.

[float]
[[config-log-level-syslog]]
==== `log_level_syslog`

`elastic_apm.log_level_syslog`

The logging level for `syslog` logging sink.
See <<configure-logging>> for details.

This setting doesn't have a default value.
