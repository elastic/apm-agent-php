[[configuration]]
== Configuration

Utilize configuration options to adapt the Elastic APM agent to your needs.
One way to configure settings is with the `php.ini` file:```

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.server_url=http://localhost:8200
elastic_apm.service_name="My service"
----

The agent can also be configured using environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8200"
export ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME="My service"
----

NOTE: If you use environment variables to configure the agent, make sure the process running your PHP code inherits those environment variables after they were set.

[[configure-ess]]
=== {ess} on {ecloud}

The agent can be configured to send data to an {ess-product}[{ess} APM instance] by
setting <<config-server-url>> and <<config-secret-token>> options
to the corresponding values found in the APM section of {ecloud}:

Configure the agent, for example via `php.ini`:

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.server_url=APM_SERVER_URL
elastic_apm.secret_token=TOKEN
elastic_apm.service_name=SERVICE_NAME
----

[float]
[[configure-logging]]
=== Logging

The easiest way to configure the logging is by using the <<config-log-level-syslog>> configuration option.

Available log levels are:

[source,text]
----
OFF
CRITICAL
ERROR
WARNING
INFO
DEBUG
TRACE
----
For example, if you specify a `WARNING` log level, only log records with levels `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`
will be emitted.

`OFF` is only used to disable agent logging.

The agent supports logging to the following sinks: syslog and stderr.
Control the level of logging for individual sinks with the
<<config-log-level-syslog>> and <<config-log-level-stderr>> options.
When a sink-specific logging level is not explicitly set, the fallback setting
<<config-log-level>> will be used.

For example, the following configuration sets the log level to `WARNING` for all the sinks:

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.log_level=WARNING
----

Alternatively, the following configuration sets log level to `WARNING` for all the sinks
except for `syslog`, where the log level is set to `TRACE`.

[source,ini]
----
elastic_apm.log_level=WARNING
elastic_apm.log_level_syslog=TRACE
----

[[config-api-key]]
==== `api_key`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_API_KEY` | `elastic_apm.api_key`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| None       | String
|============

This string is used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM Server.
You must have created the API key using the APM Server {apm-server-ref-v}/api-key.html[command line tool].

<<config-api-key>> is an alternative to <<config-secret-token>>.
If both <<config-secret-token>> and <<config-api-key>> are configured,
then <<config-api-key>> has precedence and <<config-secret-token>> is ignored.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM Server versions >= 7.6.

WARNING: The `api_key` value is sent as plain-text in every request to the server, so you should also secure
your communications using HTTPS. Unless you do so, your API Key could be observed by an attacker.

[float]
[[config-breakdown-metrics]]
==== `breakdown_metrics`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_BREAKDOWN_METRICS` | `elastic_apm.breakdown_metrics`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| true       | Boolean
|============

If it is set to `false` it disables the collection and reporting of
breakdown metrics (`span.self_time`) used for "Time spent by span type" chart.

[float]
[[config-enabled]]
==== `enabled`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_ENABLED` | `elastic_apm.enabled`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| true       | Boolean
|============

Setting to false will completely disable the agent.

[float]
[[config-environment]]
==== `environment`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_ENVIRONMENT` | `elastic_apm.environment`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| None       | String
|============

The name of the environment this service is deployed in, e.g. "production" or "staging".

Environments allow you to easily filter data on a global level in the APM app.
It's important to be consistent when naming environments across agents.
See {apm-app-ref}/filters.html#environment-selector[environment selector] in the Kibana UI for more information.

NOTE: This feature is fully supported in the APM app in Kibana versions >= 7.2.
You must use the query bar to filter for a specific environment in versions prior to 7.2.

[float]
[[config-log-level]]
==== `log_level`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL` | `elastic_apm.log_level`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| None       | Log level
|============

A fallback configuration setting to control the logging level for the agent.
Only used when a sink-specific option is not explicitly set.
See <<configure-logging>> for details.

[float]
[[config-log-level-stderr]]
==== `log_level_stderr`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL_STDERR` | `elastic_apm.log_level_stderr`

See <<configure-logging>> for details.

[float]
[[config-log-level-syslog]]
==== `log_level_syslog`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_LOG_LEVEL_SYSLOG` | `elastic_apm.log_level_syslog`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| `INFO`       | Log level
|============

The logging level for `syslog` logging sink.
See <<configure-logging>> for details.

[float]
[[config-secret-token]]
==== `secret_token`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` | `elastic_apm.secret_token`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| None       | String
|============

This string is used to ensure that only your agents can send data to your APM Server.
Both the agents and the APM Server have to be configured with the same secret token.

See {apm-server-ref-v}/secret-token.html[the relevant APM Server's documentation]
on how to configure APM Server's secret token.

Use this setting if the APM Server requires a token, like in {ess}.

<<config-secret-token>> is an alternative to <<config-api-key>>.
If both <<config-secret-token>> and <<config-api-key>> are configured
then <<config-api-key>> has precedence and <<config-secret-token>> is ignored.

WARNING: The `secret_token` is sent as plain-text in every request to the server, so you should also secure
your communications using HTTPS. Unless you do so, your secret token could be observed by an attacker.

[float]
[[config-server-timeout]]
==== `server_timeout`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_TIMEOUT` | `elastic_apm.server_timeout`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| `30s`       | Duration
|============

If a request sending events to the APM server takes longer than the configured timeout,
the request is canceled and the events are discarded.

This configuration option supports the duration suffixes: `ms`, `s` and `m`.
For example: `10s`.
This option's default unit is `s`, so `5` is interpreted as `5s`.

If the value is `0` (or `0ms`, `0s`, etc.) the timeout for sending events to the APM Server is disabled.

Negative values are invalid and result in the default value being used instead.

[float]
[[config-server-url]]
==== `server_url`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL` | `elastic_apm.server_url`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| `http://localhost:8200`       | String
|============

The URL for your APM Server. The URL must be fully qualified, including protocol (`http` or `https`) and port.

[float]
[[config-service-name]]
==== `service_name`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME` | `elastic_apm.service_name`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| `Unnamed PHP service`       | String
|============

This is used to keep all the errors and transactions of your service together
and is the primary filter in the Elastic APM user interface.

NOTE: The service name must conform to this regular expression: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _-]+$`.
In other words, a service name must only contain characters from the ASCII alphabet,
numbers, dashes, underscores, and spaces.
Characters in service name that don't match regular expression will be replaced by `_` (underscore) character.

[float]
[[config-service-version]]
==== `service_version`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_VERSION` | `elastic_apm.service_version`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| None       | String
|============

The version of the currently deployed service. If your deployments are not versioned,
the recommended value for this field is the commit identifier of the deployed revision, e.g.,
the output of git rev-parse HEAD.

[float]
[[config-transaction-max-spans]]
==== `transaction_max_spans`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_MAX_SPANS` | `elastic_apm.transaction_max_spans`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| 500       | Integer
|============

This limits the amount of spans that are recorded per transaction.
This is helpful in cases where a transaction creates a very high amount of spans,
for example, thousands of SQL queries.
Setting an upper limit helps prevent overloading the Agent and APM server in these edge cases.

If the value is `0` no spans will be collected.

Negative values are invalid and result in the default value being used instead.

[float]
[[config-transaction-sample-rate]]
==== `transaction_sample_rate`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_TRANSACTION_SAMPLE_RATE` | `elastic_apm.transaction_sample_rate`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| 1.0       | Floating-point number
|============

By default, the agent will sample every transaction (e.g., a request to your service).
To reduce overhead and storage requirements, set the sample rate to a value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
The agent still records the overall time and result for unsampled transactions,
but not context information, labels, or spans.

[float]
[[config-verify-server-cert]]
==== `verify_server_cert`

[options="header"]
|============
| Environment variable name      | Option name in `php.ini`
| `ELASTIC_APM_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT` | `elastic_apm.verify_server_cert`
|============

[options="header"]
|============
| Default                          | Type
| `true`       | Boolean
|============

By default, the agent verifies the SSL certificate if you use an HTTPS connection to the APM server.
The verification can be disabled by changing this setting to `false`.
