=== Additional Components
APM Agents work in conjunction with the {apm-guide-ref}/index.html[APM Server], {ref}/index.html[Elasticsearch], and {kibana-ref}/index.html[Kibana].
The {apm-guide-ref}/index.html[APM Guide] provides details on how these components work together,
and provides a matrix outlining {apm-guide-ref}/agent-server-compatibility.html[Agent and Server compatibility].
