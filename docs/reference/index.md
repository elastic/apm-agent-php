# APM PHP agent [intro]

The Elastic APM PHP Agent measures the performance of your application and tracks errors. It is an extension that must be installed in your PHP environment.


## Additional Components [additional-components]

APM Agents work in conjunction with the [APM Server](docs-content://solutions/observability/apps/application-performance-monitoring-apm.md), [Elasticsearch](docs-content://get-started/index.md), and [Kibana](docs-content://get-started/the-stack.md). The [APM Guide](docs-content://solutions/observability/apps/application-performance-monitoring-apm.md) provides details on how these components work together, and provides a matrix outlining [Agent and Server compatibility](docs-content://solutions/observability/apps/apm-agent-compatibility.md).
