[[build-from-source]]
==== Build from source

If you canâ€™t find your distribution, you can install the agent by building it from the source.
The following instructions will build the APM agent using the same docker environment that Elastic uses to build our official packages.

NOTE: The agent is currently only available for Linux operating system.

1. Download the agent source from https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-php/.
2. Execute the following commands to build the agent and install it:

[source,bash]
----
cd apm-agent-php
# for linux glibc - libc distributions (Ubuntu, Redhat, etc)
export BUILD_ARCHITECTURE=linux-x86-64
# for linux with musl - libc distributions (Alpine)
export BUILD_ARCHITECTURE=linuxmusl-x86-64

# build extensions
make -f .ci/Makefile build

# run extension tests
PHP_CONFIG=php-config PHP_VERSION=`$PHP_CONFIG --version | cut -d'.' -f 1,2` make -f .ci/Makefile run-phpt-tests

# install 
PHP_CONFIG=php-config sudo cp agent/native/_build/${BUILD_ARCHITECTURE}-release/ext/elastic_apm-`$PHP_CONFIG --phpapi`.so `$PHP_CONFIG --extension-dir`
----

Enable the extension by adding the following to your `php.ini` file:

[source,ini]
----
extension=elastic_apm.so
elastic_apm.bootstrap_php_part_file=<repo root>/agent/php/bootstrap_php_part.php
----

To work, the agent needs both the built `elastic_apm-*.so`
and the downloaded source files.
So if you would like to build `elastic_apm-*.so` on one machine and
then deploy it on a different machine, you will need to copy both
the built `elastic_apm-*.so` and the downloaded source files.

=== Limitations
[[limitations]]
Please be aware that if the https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.open-basedir[open_basedir] option is configured in your php.ini, the installation directory of the agent (by default /opt/elastic/apm-agent-php) must be located within a path included in the https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.open-basedir[open_basedir] configuration. Otherwise, the agent will not be loaded correctly.
