[[build-from-source]]
==== Build from source

If you canâ€™t find your distribution, you can install the agent by building it from the source.

NOTE: The agent is currently only available for Linux operating system.

1. Download the agent source from https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-php/.
2. Execute the following commands to build the agent and install it:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/ext
phpize
CFLAGS="-std=gnu99" ./configure --enable-elastic_apm
make clean
make
sudo make install
----

Enable the extension by adding the following to your `php.ini` file:

[source,php]
----
extension=elastic_apm.so
elastic_apm.bootstrap_php_part_file=<repo root>/src/bootstrap_php_part.php
----

To work, the agent needs both the built `elastic_apm.so`
and the downloaded source files.
So if you would like to build `elastic_apm.so` on one machine and
then deploy it on a different machine, you will need to copy both
the built `elastic_apm.so` and the downloaded source files.
