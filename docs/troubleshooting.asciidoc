== Troubleshooting

Is something not working as expected?
Don't worry if you can't figure out what the problem is; weâ€™re here to help!
As a first step, ensure your app is compatible with the agent's <<supported-technologies,supported technologies>>.

If you're an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the
https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/[Elastic Support portal].
Other users can post in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[APM discuss forum].

IMPORTANT: *Please upload your complete debug logs* to a service like https://gist.github.com[GitHub Gist]
so that we can analyze the problem.
Logs should include everything from when the application starts up until the first request executes.

=== Disable the Agent

In the unlikely event the agent causes disruptions to a production application,
you can disable the agent while you troubleshoot.

Disable the agent by setting <<config-enabled,`enabled`>> to `false`.
You'll need to restart your application for the changes to apply.

// ****This is the boilerplate disable text. Until dynamic config is supported, it's commented out.****
// If you have access to <<dynamic-configuration,dynamic configuration>>,
// you can disable the recording of events by setting <<config-recording,`recording`>> to `false`.
// When changed at runtime from a supported source, there's no need to restart your application.

// If that doesn't work, or you don't have access to dynamic configuration, you can disable the agent by setting
// <<config-enabled,`enabled`>> to `false`.
// You'll need to restart your application for the changes to apply.
