== Troubleshooting

Is something not working as expected?
Don't worry if you can't figure out what the problem is; weâ€™re here to help!
As a first step, ensure your app is compatible with the agent's <<supported-technologies,supported technologies>>.

If you're an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the
https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/[Elastic Support portal].
Other users can post in the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm[APM discuss forum].

IMPORTANT: *Please upload your complete debug logs* to a service like https://gist.github.com[GitHub Gist]
so that we can analyze the problem.
Logs should include everything from when the application starts up until the first request executes.

[[disable-agent]]
=== Disable the Agent

In the unlikely event the agent causes disruptions to a production application,
you can disable the agent while you troubleshoot.

Disable the agent by setting <<config-enabled,`enabled`>> to `false`.
You'll need to restart your application for the changes to apply.

// ****This is the boilerplate disable text. Until dynamic config is supported, it's commented out.****
// If you have access to <<dynamic-configuration,dynamic configuration>>,
// you can disable the recording of events by setting <<config-recording,`recording`>> to `false`.
// When changed at runtime from a supported source, there's no need to restart your application.

// If that doesn't work, or you don't have access to dynamic configuration, you can disable the agent by setting
// <<config-enabled,`enabled`>> to `false`.
// You'll need to restart your application for the changes to apply.

[[dev-internal-config-disclaimer]]
=== Disclaimer for `dev_internal_*` configuration options
Configuration options starting with `dev_internal_` should be used only for supportability.
It's recommended to have these options in the configuration for the short periods of time
while resolving an issue with the agent.
There is no backward compatability guarantee for these options
so any one can be changed and/or removed even in a minor or patch release.

[[enable-verbose-log-backend-comm]]
=== Enable verbose log for backend communication
Configuration option `dev_internal_backend_comm_log_verbose` can be used
to enable verbose log for the agent's communication with Elastic APM Server.
